# Trading Strategy Simulator

## Project Description

Developed a Stock Market Simulator using Python, leveraging yfinance, pandas, and numpy to fetch, preprocess, and analyze over 5 years of historical and real-time stock market data, enhancing decision-making for trading strategies.

Designed and implemented a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) with Tkinter, incorporating interactive widgets and integrated matplotlib plots to visualize 6 key technical indicators, including SMA, EMA, MACD, Bollinger Bands, and SuperTrend.

Automated the generation of buy and sell signals based on technical analysis, providing clear visual markers and summary reports that supported a 20% increase in data-driven trading decisions.

**Trading Strategy Simulator** is a Python-based desktop application that enables users to analyze stock market trends using various technical indicators. Leveraging historical stock data from Yahoo Finance, the application calculates and visualizes indicators such as Moving Averages, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Volume Trend, SuperTrend, and Pivot Points. With an intuitive Tkinter-based GUI, users can easily enter stock tickers, select date ranges, and generate insightful visualizations and buy/sell signals to support informed trading decisions. Ideal for both learning and developing trading strategies, this tool is essential for stock market enthusiasts and traders.
